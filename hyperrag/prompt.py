PROMPTS["entity_extraction"] = """-Goal-
Given a text document related to some knowledge or story and a list of entity types, identify all entities of these types from the text. Then construct hyperedges by extracting complex relationships among the identified entities.
Use {language} as output language.

-Steps-

1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:

- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities.
- additional_properties: Other attributes possibly associated with the entity, like time, space, emotion, motivation, etc.
Format each entity as ("Entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>{tuple_delimiter}<additional_properties>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- entities_pair: The name of source entity and target entity, as identified in step 1.
- edge_type: One of the following relation types: [{relation_types}]
- low_order_relationship_description: Explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other.
- low_order_relationship_keywords: Keywords that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details.
- low_order_relationship_strength: A numerical score indicating the strength of the relationship between the entities.
Format each hyperedge as ("Low-order Hyperedge"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name1>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name2>{tuple_delimiter}<edge_type>{tuple_delimiter}<low_order_relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<low_order_relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<low_order_relationship_strength>)

3. Based on the relationships identified in Step 2, extract high-level keywords that summarize the main idea, major concept, or themes of the important passage. 
(Note: The content of high-level keywords should capture the overarching ideas present in the document, avoiding vague or empty terms).
Format content keywords as ("High-level keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

4. For the entities identified in step 1, based on the entity pair relationships in step 2 and the high-level keywords extracted in Step 3, find connections or commonalities among multiple entities and construct high-order associated entity set as much as possible.
(Note: Avoid forcibly merging everything into a single association. If high-level keywords are not strongly associated, construct separate association). 
Extract the following information from all related entities, entity pairs, and high-level keywords:

- entities_set: The collection of names for elements in high-order associated entity set, as identified in step 1.
- edge_type: One of the following high-order relation types: [{high_order_relation_types}]
- high_order_relationship_description: Use the relationships among the entities in the set to create a detailed, smooth, and comprehensive description that covers all entities in the set, without leaving out any relevant information.
- high_order_relationship_generalization: Summarize the content of the entity set as concisely as possible.
- high_order_relationship_keywords: Keywords that summarize the overarching nature of the high-order association, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details.
- high_order_relationship_strength: A numerical score indicating the strength of the association among the entities in the set.
Format each association as ("High-order Hyperedge"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name1>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name2>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_nameN>{tuple_delimiter}<edge_type>{tuple_delimiter}<high_order_relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<high_order_relationship_generalization>{tuple_delimiter}<high_order_relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<high_order_relationship_strength>)

5. Return output in {language} as a single list of all entities, relationships and associations identified in steps 1, 2 and 4. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

6. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

You are a helpful medical assistant.

---Goal---

Answer the user's question based on the evidence in the data tables below when available.
- When the data tables contain relevant evidence, base your answer primarily on them and reflect what the evidence shows.
- When the data tables are empty or lack enough evidence, you MAY answer using your general medical knowledge, but you MUST explicitly state that the answer is not grounded in the provided evidence (e.g. "Note: the provided evidence was empty; the following relies on general medical knowledge.").
- Do not present information that contradicts the provided evidence.
- If you genuinely cannot answer, say so plainly.

You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying both high-level and low-level keywords in the user's query.

---Goal---

Given the query, list both high-level and low-level keywords. High-level keywords focus on overarching concepts or themes, while low-level keywords focus on specific entities, details, or concrete terms.

---Instructions---

- Output the keywords in JSON format.
- The JSON should have two keys:
  - "high_level_keywords" for overarching concepts or themes.
  - "low_level_keywords" for specific entities or details.

-Examples-
######################
Example 1:

Query: "How does international trade influence global economic stability?"
################
Output:
{{
  "high_level_keywords": ["International trade", "Global economic stability", "Economic impact"],
  "low_level_keywords": ["Trade agreements", "Tariffs", "Currency exchange", "Imports", "Exports"]
}}

Example 2:

Query: "What are the environmental consequences of deforestation on biodiversity?"
################
Output:
{{
  "high_level_keywords": ["Environmental consequences", "Deforestation", "Biodiversity loss"],
  "low_level_keywords": ["Species extinction", "Habitat destruction", "Carbon emissions", "Rainforest", "Ecosystem"]

You are a medical query analyzer. Your task is to classify a medical question into a structured route.

---Goal---
Analyze the given question and output a JSON object with the following fields:

1. "query_type": one of "factual", "relation", "mechanism", "comparison", "complex"
   - factual: asks for a definition, symptom, or single-point fact (e.g., "What is multiple sclerosis?")
   - relation: asks about the relationship/association between A and B (e.g., "What is the relationship between hypertension and stroke?")
   - mechanism: asks about a pathological mechanism, process, or "why" (e.g., "How does the blood-brain barrier work?")
   - comparison: asks about differences, comparisons, pros/cons (e.g., "What is the difference between Alzheimer's and vascular dementia?")
   - complex: multi-condition, multi-hop, or comprehensive reasoning (e.g., "What treatments are available for a patient with both epilepsy and depression?")

2. "complexity": one of "simple", "medium", "complex"
   - simple: single entity, direct lookup, no reasoning chain
   - medium: requires connecting 2-3 entities or one reasoning step
   - complex: multi-hop reasoning, multiple conditions, or broad synthesis

3. "focus_types": a list of strings from ["entity", "relation", "mechanism", "text"]
   - entity: the answer primarily needs entity-level facts
   - relation: the answer primarily needs relationships between entities
   - mechanism: the answer primarily needs process/mechanism descriptions
   - text: the answer primarily needs source text passages

4. "reason": a brief one-sentence explanation of your classification
